 // Brief Description of what you did: built a page for pokemon to list characters and their information and images by either search the name/number or click Random Button; also the user is ablt to save to favorits and retrieve or delete the added names; you can delete the name by either clicking the icon(heart) or clicking on the X button of the name in teh favorites list.

// Peer Review: I find the design of the site to be simple, yet extremely effective. It works really well, and everything is displayed in an orderly manner. It's also very responsive, impressively so. And the favorites bar was super cool, implemented very well. The only two problems I had were that the evolutions are not displayed properly, and there is not an obvious imdication as to how to toggle between the image of a pokemon's normal and shiny form (which is done by clicking on the image, but some sort of indication would further help streamline the experience of the website). Overall, an incredible job with the site, even with its simplicity.
